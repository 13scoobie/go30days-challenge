"Less thinking, more hacking"
“Reading Code Is Key to Writing Good Code” - Steven Harman

Golang hacking rules:
1. Close all the browser tabs first except one
2. Look at some pre written code and copy it 
3. Start modifying the code
4. No learning/videos during the hack hour
6. Only other app allowed is a music app maybe
7. Google shit when you get stuck
8. Do this for 30 days
9. I skipped #5, but you're too distracted to notice it
10. Pick any random Golang repo and Github and hack it
11. gogogogogogogogogogogogogoggogogogogo!!!


Tips:
1. Use https://sourcegraph.com to quickly understand the code you're hacking 
2. Use reddit.com/golang for ideas 
3. Listen to video game music playlist from my spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/patelgunjan5/playlist/5MzpaOxp8HTux6wUxkCAtX
