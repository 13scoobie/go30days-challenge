30 days golang challenge (30 minutes hack everyday)
"Less thinkingg, more hacking"

Golang hacking rules:
1. Close all the browser tabs first except one

2. Look at some pre written code and copy it 

3. Start modifying the code

4. No learning/videos during the hack hour

6. Only other app allowed is a music app maybe

7. Google shit when you get stuck

8. Do this for 30 days

9. I skipped #5, but you're too distracted to notice it

10. Pick any random Golang repo and Github and hack it

11. gogogogogogogogogogogogogoggogogogogo!!!

Tips:
1. Use https://sourcegraph.com to quickly understand the code you're hacking 

2. Use reddit.com/golang for ideas 

3. Listen to video game music playlist from my spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/patelgunjan5/playlist/5MzpaOxp8HTux6wUxkCAtX

4. Coffee!!
