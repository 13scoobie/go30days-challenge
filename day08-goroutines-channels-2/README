moar mucking with concurrency in GO

TIL:
-execution stack for goroutines is very small compared to processor threads stack (2KB vs 1MB)
-little pressure on the system
-goroutines (aka green threads) = actors 
-goroutine memory requirement is much less than processor thread (2KB vs 1MB), go runtime allocates more if needed
-channels provide typed message communication
-channels are used to provide synchronization between goroutines
-channels don't allow sender to modify the message once it's sent
-GOMAXPROCS lets you assign more logical processors
