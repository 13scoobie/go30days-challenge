Hi Gunjan,<br /><br />I am a Developer Relations Engineer and part of the Developer Relations team at source{d}, based in Madrid. We are a rapidly growing startup working on improving developer recruitment. We have analyzed your open source contributions on Github and have concluded that your experience could be a good fit as a Go Engineer at Lovoo.<br /><br />Lovoo (http://lovoo.com/) is a Social Discovery Network where users can meet friendly people in their immediate vicinity. The patented Live Radar is the heart of the app. This feature allows you to contact other members anywhere and at any time, to chat with them and keep in touch. <br /><br />For this position Lovoo is looking for an engineer with experience in sites with high traffic and optimizing for performance. Professional experience with Go is desirable but if you have worked in similar challenges in other languages (for instance, Erlang, C++ or Java), or have dabbled with Go, that would be a good fit as well. <br /><br />Apart from working in one of the fastest growing startups in Europe (in their offices in Berlin), you would get to work on a system dealing with more than 5 million requests/minute, working mainly in the Go middleware components. <br /><br />The salary range would be between 40.000€ and 80.000€. <br /><br />Should this be something you wish to explore, please let me know and we can set up a call to evaluate in depth if this is a good fit for you and Lovoo.<br /><br />Our technology is constantly evolving, so if we mismatched you for the role please accept my apologies and feel free to let us know. Also, if you think that this position does not match your profile or interests, you can drop me a line and I will be more than happy to discuss any other potential opportunities we have that are a better fit for you.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you,<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />---<br />Miguel Diaz, Developer Relations Engineer<br />http://sourced.tech<br /><br />Claudio Coello 16, 2º Izq.<br />28001 Madrid, Spain<br /><div><img src="https://tracking.sourced.tech/track/56608dfe36d54504a38e4588" alt="" /></div>
